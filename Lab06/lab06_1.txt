1:  The program will sort books by genre.

2:  All books given to the program must be sorted into the correct genre.

3a: Because this is a supervised learning problem, the set of books supplied to the program
    will have known genres that can be tested for correctness.
 b: The key result is the predicted genre for the given book, that can be evaluated against the
    known genres.
 c: The model is determined to be a failure if it does not correctly sort books or does not
    sort books at all.

4a: The output for this ML model is a book and its predicted genre.
 b: The output is two strings, the first returning the input (book) and the second the predicted
    genre of the book.

5a: The output will be supplied to the user immediately in a UI. This must happen within 10
    seconds.
 b: The output will be used by the user to find other books of the same genre to read next.

6:  A rule based approach would be used. Sample rules:
       if "magic" in book: book = fantasy
       specific authors always sort into their genres
       if "kiss" in book n times: book = romance

7a: Our problem is best framed as a multi-class single-label classification which predicts a
    single genre for each book we are given.
 b: Our problem can be reduced to a binary classification (fiction or nonfiction)

8:  Input: Author, title, text, summary
    Output: Genre

9:  Author, title, and summary come from Amazon.
    Full texts come from Google Books or a similar resource.

10: Author, title, and summary would be easy to obtain and would produce a reasonable outcome.
