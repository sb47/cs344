For this project I am classifying dogs by breed, using an
existing dataset of dog images. Because these images have
defined breeds, I used supervised machine learning. More
specifically, a convolutional neural network was used
because they are designed to process images.


Code modules can be found in the "Code" directory. Their
uses are as follows:

"dog_images.py": Defines a class to handle image formatting
and storage into usable variables.

"dogClassifier.ipynb": "main" code that can be executed
step by step to build and run the neural network. This file
calls classes and methods from the other files.

"image_classifier.py": Defines a class with methods to
do the inner workings of the neural network.


The image data can be found at the following link:
"https://github.com/NeverForged/DogClassifier/tree/master/Images"

The data will need to be downloaded and placed in "Data/Images/"
from the root directory of the project for it to run properly.
