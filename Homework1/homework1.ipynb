    "Early psychologists used the process of introspection to study the human mind. Introspection is the self-examination of one's thoughts and feelings. This process relies only on the self-observer and is therefore subject to all inaccuracies or biases of the subject. One can do only a small amount of digging into the history of introspection and easily recognize the vast limitations of the practice. One of the main limitations is the false confidence of subjects relating their mental processes. A phenominon called the \"introspection illusion\" occurs when people using introspection are unaware of their unawareness, and contributes to the inaccuracy of the method."

    "Becuase of the inaccurate nature of introspection, it is no surprise that the method does not model the human cognitive process well enough to properly inform efforts in artificial intelligence. Whatever introspective models are used to formulate AI would not properly mirror the working of the mind. An alternative to modeling the entire human mind with introspection is to instead model parts of the cognitive process, like logic or selection of alternatives."
