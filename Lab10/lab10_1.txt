Part a:
    Keras is built on top of TensorFlow and is much easier to use,
    especially to quickly set up a neural network with little code.
    However, TensorFlow is more customizable. For my limited experience
    building neural networks, I would prefer to use Keras.

Part b:
    Task 1:
        learning_rate=0.001
        steps=2000
        batch_size=100
        hidden_units=[10, 10]
        Final validation RMSE = 112.64
    Task 2:
        Final test RMSE = 108.6
