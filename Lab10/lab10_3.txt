Part a:
    The confusion matrix shows which classes were misclassified. This
    acts as a measure of the inaccuracy of the model.
Part b:
    The TensorFlow network has a neural network specific configuration
    with a hyperparameter for hidden units.
Part c:
    The image quality varies with the number of steps taken.
