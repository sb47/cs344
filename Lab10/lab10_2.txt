Part a:
    AdaGrad modifies the learning rate adaptively for each model
    coefficient, which lowers the effective learning rate.
Part b:
    Task 1:
        Final RMSE (validation) = 103.97
    Task 2:
        Final RMSE (validation) with Adagrad = 71.05
        Final RMSE (validation) with ADAM = 69.37
    Task 3:
        Final RMSE (validation) = 71.92
