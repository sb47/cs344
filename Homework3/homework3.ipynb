    "A network of perceptrons can compute the XOR function, but it requires multiple layers. In a single layer, pereptrons can compute an OR or an AND function and their inverses. An equivalent function to the XOR is [(-AND) AND (OR)], and all of those individual operations are computable by perceptron layers. Below is outlined the inner workings of the layers of the network."
