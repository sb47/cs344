Part a:
    Final RMSE: 0.44

Part b:
    L2 Loss does not penalize miscalculations when the output is seen as a probability. LogLoss
    however does penalize "confidence errors" more severely.

Parc c:
    The RMSE for the logistic regression is worse, as expected because it properly penalizes the
    errors explained above. Final RMSE: 0.55

Part d:
    Final RMSE: 0.46
    AUC: 0.81
    Accuracy on validation set: 0.78
    Hyperparameters:
        learning_rate: 0.000003
        steps: 20000
        batch_size: 500
