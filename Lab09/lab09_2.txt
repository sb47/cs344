Part a:
    Regularizing by using a function that encourages zero weights will sparsify the the data. This
    is useful because it will avoid overfitting and make the resulting model more efficient.

Part b:
    L1 regularization uses zero weights for parameters of the data features that are not important
    for the solution. This greatly simplifies the dataset by only having features present that are
    needed.

Part c:
    Final LogLoss value: 0.26
    learning_rate=0.1
    regularization_strength=0.1
    steps=300
    batch_size=100
