Exercise 1:
    Part i:
        Cat training: 1000
        Dog training: 1000
        Cat validation: 500
        Dog validation: 500
    Part ii:
        The convnet convolution uses 3x3 windows and then 2x2 windows for the maxpooling layers, which
        is the same as in class. What is different is that the input is larger images (150x150) and is
        also in color, making it a 3-D input layer.
    Part iii:
        In the intermediate layers the images become smaller and less detailed, until in lower layers
        the images are no longer distinguishable.

Exercise 2:
    Part i:
        Data augmentation fights overfitting by randomly transforming the training examples each time
        they are used, so that the model will never see the exact same picture twice.
    Part ii:
        Results:
            val_loss: 0.4911

            steps_per_epoch=100
            epochs=30
