Part a:
    Seaborn is complimentary to Matplotlib and specializes in data
    visualization. Seaborn also makes difficult tasks in Matplotlib
    easier to perform.

Part b:
    The dataset has nearly 400 entries. This number of entries is rather
    low for training a model, especially when splitting the dataset into
    training, testing, and validation sets.

Part c:
    Normalization will ensure that all data uses the same scales and
    ranges, making it much easier to compare data points on a strictly
    numerical basis.

Part d:
    Although this example is a regression problem, most of the
    characteristics analyzed do not follow a linear model, most of them
    instead following a quadratic or other power function model.

Part e:
    I agree that smaller datasets prefer smaller networks because of
    overfitting. With a small dataset, overfitting occurs very easily
    and can be best avoided by using smaller, simpler networks without
    as many layers.
