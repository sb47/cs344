a:
    Categorical data is stored as strings while numerical data is stored as numbers.
b:
    Ex 1:
            train_model(
            learning_rate=0.00002,
            steps=400,
            batch_size=6
            )
        Output:
            Final RMSE (on training data): 171.40
    Ex 2:
            train_model(
            learning_rate=0.00002,
            steps=1000,
            batch_size=5,
            input_feature="population"
)
        Output:
            Final RMSE (on training data): 175.99
c:
    The Hyper-parameters in this exercise are the learning_rate, the number of steps, and the batch_size.
    These parameters are used to determine the details of the model used to make predictions.
    I did not find a standard tuning method for these parameters.
