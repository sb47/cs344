a:
    Exercise 1: cities['Has saint name and large'] = (cities['Area square miles'] > 50) & cities['City name'].apply(lambda name: name.startswith('San'))
                cities
    Exercise 2: cities.reindex([7, 1, 4, 5])
b:
    Pandas has a very easy to use interface and has very mutable data. Also, the data printouts
    are visually appealing
c:
    Data reordering is useful when wanting to sort by a specific category, such as population
    or square mile area
